    <h1>Machine Learning Ranking</h1>
    <p>Learning to rank models optimize search relevance by combining lexical signals with semantic embeddings. Features like click-through-rate, dwell time, and query intent vectors power ranking improvements.</p>
    <p>Pairwise ranking losses and gradient boosted decision trees are common baselines before deploying transformer-based rerankers.</p>
